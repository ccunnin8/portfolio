Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick.
